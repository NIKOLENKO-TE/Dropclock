# DROPCLOCK

A Web Version of the famous Dropclock Screensaver (originated from http://scr.sc)

### Information

This is an adaption of the Dropclock Screensaver for running in a browser.
<br>As this version is based on the original flash files, flash needs to be enabled.

### Platform

This version was build to run on a Raspberry Pi 3+, but it is still very performance intense.
<br>An optimized version switching to mp4-videos instead of swf is planned.

### Progress

ToDo:

- [ ] Add option for color inversion (white mode)
- [ ] Convert SWF to mp4 due to performance
- [ ] Add fadings on number change
- [ ] Handle start situation (black screen)
- [ ] Optimize asset loading

Done:

- [x] Add random start delay
- [x] Implement basic swf playback
- [x] Setup base layout
